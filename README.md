Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
For Project Three, I built an event tracking app so users can create, view, and manage events quickly on mobile. The goal was a clean, reliable way to capture details and see what’s coming up without digging through notes or desktop tools (Android Developers, n.d.-a). 
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I implemented a login screen, an event list, and an event create/edit screen. The UI followed Material patterns for structure, hierarchy, and accessibility so the flow felt familiar and easy to scan (Android Developers, n.d.-b). 
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I broke work into small increments, built one screen at a time, and verified each change with quick emulator runs. That iterative rhythm keeps complexity manageable and scales well to future projects. I also checked against Android’s quality guidance to keep usability front and center (Android Developers, n.d.-e). 
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I did exploratory testing in the emulator, tried edge cases (empty inputs, long titles), and navigated across screens to catch layout or state issues early. Testing protects both functionality and experience and surfaced how small constraint tweaks can change usability (Android Developers, n.d.-e). 
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Displaying many events without clutter pushed me to use RecyclerView, which renders lists efficiently and stays smooth as content grows (Android Developers, n.d.-d). 
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The event list felt strongest. Implementing RecyclerView with clear item layouts showed I can balance performance with a user first design (Android Developers, n.d.-d). 
Looking ahead
I’m going to prep this app for a real Play Store launch so I can practice signing, releases, and updates using Google’s launch checklist (Android Developers, n.d.-c).
